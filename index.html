            comic-magazine or simply 'comic,' is a publication that consists of comics art in the form
            of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by

            of the comics art form.

        <h4 class="subtitle">Horror Fiction</h4>
        <p class="para">
            Horror is a genre of speculative fiction that is intended to disturb, frighten,
            or scare.[1] Horror is often divided into the sub-genres of psychological horror and
            supernatural horror, which are in the realm of speculative fiction. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon,
            in 1984, defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length ... which shocks,
            or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".[2] Horror intends
            to create an eerie and frightening atmosphere for the reader. Often the central menace of a work
            of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for larger fears of a society.

        <h4 class="subtitle">Mystery fiction</h4>
        <p class="para">
            Mystery is a fiction genre where the nature of an event, usually a murder or other crime,
            remains mysterious until the end of the story.[1] Often within a closed circle of suspects,
            each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing
            the crime. The central character is often a detective (such as Sherlock Holmes), who eventually solves
            the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader.[2] Some mystery books are
            non-fiction. Mystery fiction can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or
            suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit. Mystery fiction can be
            contrasted with hardboiled detective stories, which focus on action and gritty realism
